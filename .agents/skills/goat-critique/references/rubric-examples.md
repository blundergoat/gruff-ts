# Critique Rubric Examples (Reference Pack)

*Extracted from the goat-critique SKILL.md to stay within the 2500-word skill cap. Artifact rubrics remain in SKILL.md; the canonical meta-audit rubric, worked examples, and context maps live here.*

## Rubric Context Maps

Each map lists additions to the fixed Context split in `SKILL.md` and never replaces it. Agents A and B keep their artifact, architecture, and rubric baseline; an empty C list means no additional project context, so C still receives the supplied artifact + selected rubric payload only. Footgun/lesson entries mean targeted INDEX-first hits from those buckets, not whole-directory reads. Every map uses **Fresh-eyes boundary and recovery** in `sub-agent-directives.md`; none grants additional C reads. Generic fallback uses the default split plus the additions below.

### Plan
- **A:** targeted INDEX-first footgun/lesson hits, `.goat-flow/learning-loop/decisions/`
- **B:** relevant selected milestone artifacts, `git log --oneline -20`
- **C:** [] (no additional project context)

Prefer the explicitly supplied milestone/set. Otherwise use `.goat-flow/plans/.active` as an advisory locator and resolve the relevant milestone files; ask when the intended plan is ambiguous. `<active>` need not be a version directory. This is read-only context selection: never switch `.active`, change milestone status, or load all historical plans. Milestone logs do not replace the selected artifacts.

### Security assessment
- **A:** targeted INDEX-first footgun/lesson hits, threat-model docs, `.goat-flow/learning-loop/decisions/`
- **B:** `git log --oneline -20`, config.yaml, dependency manifests
- **C:** [] (no additional project context)

### Debug hypotheses
- **A:** targeted INDEX-first footgun/lesson hits, `.goat-flow/logs/sessions/`
- **B:** `git log --oneline -20`, config.yaml, test output
- **C:** [] (no additional project context)

### Review findings
- **A:** targeted INDEX-first footgun/lesson hits, `.goat-flow/learning-loop/decisions/`
- **B:** `git log --oneline -20`, config.yaml, CI logs
- **C:** [] (no additional project context)

### Test strategy
- **A:** targeted INDEX-first footgun/lesson hits, `.goat-flow/learning-loop/decisions/`
- **B:** `git log --oneline -20`, config.yaml, test manifests
- **C:** [] (no additional project context)

### Architecture/refactor
- **A:** targeted INDEX-first footgun/lesson hits, `.goat-flow/learning-loop/decisions/`, dependency maps
- **B:** `git log --oneline -20`, config.yaml, module boundaries
- **C:** [] (no additional project context)

### Generic (fallback)
- **A:** targeted INDEX-first footgun/lesson hits
- **B:** `git log --oneline -20`, config.yaml
- **C:** [] (no additional project context)

## Worked examples

> **Illustrative scenario - input/output shape only; never evidence.** Every artifact path, finding, command outcome, and prior-log id below is a placeholder. Live critique must substitute target-project files plus semantic anchors re-read in the current session.

### Full phase walkthrough: Phase 2 context-leak edge case

- **Artifact:** supplied inline `skills/goat-example/SKILL.md` content, including its Tests section.
- **Rubric:** Generic fallback, supplied inline with an `architecture.md#scope` identity.
- **Agent C output under review:** references to those two supplied identities and the ordinary word tests.
- **Phase 2 actions:** scan the response through stdin; trace both candidate references to the payload and disregard tests as navigation.
- **Expected Phase 2 result:** accept the references, record exposed activity or its absence, then check completeness. A clean scan alone proves no isolation.
- **Leak variant:** an observed unauthorized read ends C's use. Discard its return and use the shared replacement counter; never restart that child.

### Example: Plan rubric critique output

```markdown
## Finding: Verification belongs after execution, not only during synthesis
- **Finding ID:** F-01 | **Severity:** HIGH | **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Evidence:** `<target-project>/plan.md` (search: "Verification gate") - current-session size and version checks found state drift after the draft plan was written
- **Proof attempt:** Re-read the target plan's verification gate and ran the named current-state checks
- **Proof class:** RUNTIME
- **Evidence quality:** OBSERVED
- **SKEPTIC:** A plan can look internally consistent while the repo has drifted underneath it
- **ANALYST:** The failure appeared only when live commands re-checked the current files, so synthesis alone was insufficient
- **STRATEGIST:** Keep an execution-adjacent verification gate and cite the command output before closing the milestone
- **Rubric dimensions:** validation coverage [O], sequencing quality [M]
```

### Example: Architecture/refactor rubric critique output

```markdown
## Finding: Quick critique fallback would break the skill mechanism
- **Finding ID:** F-02 | **Severity:** HIGH | **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Evidence:** `<target-project>/decisions/critique-mode.md` (search: "delegated critique mode") - the current decision binds critique to isolated agents rather than inline role-play
- **Proof attempt:** Re-read the target decision and confirmed that it rejects a quick inline fallback
- **Proof class:** STATIC
- **Evidence quality:** OBSERVED
- **SKEPTIC:** Reintroducing quick mode would make the output promise multi-perspective critique without isolated contexts
- **ANALYST:** `/goat-review` already covers lightweight single-context review, so the fallback duplicates another skill and weakens this one
- **STRATEGIST:** Keep goat-critique full-delegated and route low-ceremony requests to goat-review
- **Rubric dimensions:** blast radius accuracy [M], migration safety [M], dependency impact [O]
```

## Differential baselines

`artifact_identity` uses the normalized selected-project root by default; a human-declared portable project ID may explicitly replace it. Normalize relative path separators and dot segments, preserve case and scope selectors, and sort/deduplicate artifact-set members. Inline material needs a declared identity. Content hashes belong separately in `assessed_state`. Same basenames in different directories/projects do not match. Project moves, renames and changed set membership require explicit mapping.

Within 30 days, offer differential mode for matching identity. Prefer finalized findings even when outcomes are pending; a selected preliminary baseline must say preliminary. Record the baseline's record ID and project-relative path, plus source locator or unavailable reason, in `baseline`. A filename suffix is not its identity.

| Prior source | Permitted comparison |
|---|---|
| Immutable Git commit/blob and path/set, successfully retrieved at the declared project | Artifact diff plus evidenced findings comparison |
| Available ignored/supplied source, or retained scrubbed snapshot proven byte-equivalent to the bounded original | Artifact diff while identity and equivalence hold |
| Redaction-altered or unknown-equivalence snapshot/receipt | Receipt or findings comparison only |
| Digest or summary without recoverable bytes | Artifact-diff-unavailable; bounded findings comparison where evidence permits |

Do not archive raw ignored artifacts or create Git objects to manufacture a baseline. A digest can verify available bytes; it cannot reconstruct missing ones. Prove a scrubbed snapshot's equivalence before treating it as source authority.

Before the initial critic batch, give A/B bounded relevant prior findings and any available artifact diff, with exact baseline identity and limits. Preserve their fixed context split and five-call limits. C receives only current artifact/rubric; do not claim omitted critic work occurred.

### Delta accounting

Map claims using artifact identity, semantic anchor, claim and stable source IDs, retaining merge/split mappings without double-counting. Each prior finding is exactly one of `unchanged`, `resolved`, `regressed`, `unassessed`, `unmapped`. New findings belong only to the current set.

Report `Resolved: N | Regressed: M | New: K | Unchanged: J`, plus explicit unassessed/unmapped counts and reasons. Prior total = unchanged + resolved + regressed + unassessed + unmapped. Link the selected record by ID and path.

Changed or unchanged classifications and each new finding need current evidence; absence from this report never proves resolution. Unassessed lacks current proof; unmapped lacks established identity. Regression requires evidenced worsening or recurrence after evidenced prior resolution, not a renamed title.

## Saved records and recovery

Use one Markdown metadata block per record; this is a document contract, not a runtime parser. Create a `run_id` once; resume retains it, while a deliberate rerun gets a new run ID. Each fresh record gets its own `record_id`.

| Metadata field | Required value |
|---|---|
| `record_schema_version`, `skill_version` | Schema revision `1` and actual loaded skill version |
| `run_id`, `record_id`, `phase`, `created_at` | Opaque run ID, unique record ID, phase below, UTC creation time |
| `source_record` | Predecessor ID and project-relative path; otherwise null with a missing-source reason |
| `artifact_identity`, `assessed_state` | Selected project and artifact/path-set identity; assessed content identity separately |
| `report_revision`, `audited_revision` | Report payload revision and revision actually graded; null with reason when inapplicable |
| `baseline` | Selected prior record and available source locator, or unavailable reason; permitted comparison type |
| `limitations`, `retry_state` | Coverage/persistence limits and already-used C replacement and meta-recheck allowances |

| Phase | Save when; required body | Resume at |
|---|---|---|
| `pre-clarification` | Before Phase 4, even with no questions: Phase 1–3 findings, coverage, verification, retractions and pending questions | Phase 4 |
| `finalized` | After meta-audit, before the final human gate: complete final findings, Phase 4 decisions, exact audited draft/meta result, limitations and pending final question; link preliminary record when available | Final human gate |
| `outcomes` | After an actual response: `## Outcomes` with exact reply and per-finding dispositions; link finalized record and its finding IDs | Follow-up context, comparing through finalized findings |

### Save protocol

Keep every draft in memory. Pipe it through stdin to the preamble-selected `goat-flow redact --output .goat-flow/logs/critiques/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<HHMM>-<artifact-slug>-<rand5>.md` or matching source CLI; only redactor destination bytes may reach disk. Check each destination is absent. The random suffix prevents collisions; filenames are not run or artifact identities. Never append to or overwrite an earlier record.

If unavailable or redaction fails, write nothing, emit `persist-skipped: redactor-unavailable`, and continue to the applicable human gate. Identify which phase failed and which earlier saves succeeded. A later save declares a missing predecessor instead of inventing its path. No raw fallback or whole-run persistence claim after a failed final/outcome save.

Verify saved bytes and links before claiming persistence. If redaction changes audited report content, apply **Audit payload identity** below: use its remaining recheck allowance or mark the saved revision unaudited. Metadata and an unchanged audit wrapper alone do not change the payload.

### Human outcomes

A defaults to `accepted`; D defaults to `deferred`. For B/C, preserve the actual dig-deeper/rerun request; map only explicit per-finding decisions. Use `human_disposition: null` with a pending reason when unspecified. The only non-null values are `accepted`, `rejected`, `deferred`, `partial`; partial means partial human acceptance, never missing information. An investigation request does not supply a disposition.

### Resume selection

Read phase and verified source links, not modification times or the largest filename. Linked records must agree on run/artifact identity and finding IDs. Ambiguous candidates or conflicting links require a human choice; a missing predecessor remains explicit. Legacy records remain readable with unknown/preliminary/legacy provenance, without migration or inferred finality.

Re-read the current artifact identity and assessed bytes. Unchanged bytes permit continuation; drift requires a human choice to finish the recorded state or start a new critique. Never combine fresh bytes with old findings silently. Preserve retry counters. An existing finalized record with no outcomes resumes the final human gate without repeating critics or saving a duplicate final draft. If an actual reply was not saved, ask for it again. A saved accepted recommendation is continuity evidence, never independent permission to apply in a new session.

## Meta-audit rubric (Phase 5.5)

The meta-agent scores the draft critique against these 10 checks. Award 10 only when a check is fully satisfied, otherwise 0; partial credit is forbidden. `Meta-score` is the sum. Name every failed check under `## Auto-Detected Issues`. When all 10 checks pass, write exactly `No failed meta-audit checks.` A clean attestation is not an issue and must not be expanded into one.

The meta-agent grades the packet it is handed and nothing else. It does not open the artifact, the main skill or the project. Every term the ten rules use is therefore defined here, and the packet carries the draft, the selected dimensions, the final-finding schema, the vocabulary below and these ten rules.

### Packet vocabulary

- **Title:** the finding's short defect statement. It may sit inline in the finding record rather than as a separately labelled field; check 2 grades that a reader can state what the defect is, not where the words sit.
- **Severity, highest to lowest:** CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW. The producing agent sets it; check 8 grades whether comparable evidenced effects were rated consistently within this one report, never whether a rating is correct in the abstract.
- **Proof class, one of:** `RUNTIME`, `CONTRACT-GREP`, `STATIC`, `NOT-REPRODUCED`. Records how the claim was checked.
- **Evidence quality, one of:** `OBSERVED`, `INFERRED`, `UNVERIFIED`, `HUMAN-PENDING`. Records the claim's evidential support, independently of proof class and confidence.
- **Confidence, one of:** HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW. Records the certainty judgment, not the evidence's provenance or support label.
- **Per-finding fields check 2 requires,** and this list governs: Finding ID, title, severity, rubric dimensions, evidence anchor, Proof attempt, Proof class, Evidence quality, confidence, the three lens fields SKEPTIC, ANALYST and STRATEGIST, Host verification and Source agent IDs. A lens field may read `N/A` with a reason. Recommended action is required only when the finding warrants one; otherwise its omission does not fail check 2. The Final-finding schema defines those additions.
- **[M] and [O]:** a selected dimension is mandatory or optional. Check 3 grades honesty identically for both: an [M] dimension may be `unassessed` when the row gives a reason and the next evidence needed.
- **Not graded here:** the report's Risk level, its section layout and names, the wording or naming of a hook, whether a surviving finding also appears under recommendations, and how confidence relates to Evidence quality. The ten checks grade only what they name. Report a rule you cannot find rather than assuming one.

| # | Check | Complete passing rule |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Gate-finding match** | Any CRITICAL gives BLOCK; HIGH without CRITICAL gives CONCERNS; otherwise CLEAN |
| 2 | **Evidence quality per finding** | Every final finding retains every field in the Packet vocabulary's per-finding list, including Proof attempt, Proof class and Evidence quality |
| 3 | **Rubric coverage completeness** | Every selected dimension has an honest disposition and supporting evidence or a stated limitation; incomplete inspection is not an artifact defect |
| 4 | **Recommendation actionability** | Each recommendation traces to a surviving finding ID and gives a concrete next action |
| 5 | **Retraction rationale** | Every retraction identifies the discarded finding ID and why it was withdrawn |
| 6 | **Contradictions** | Mutually exclusive claims are reconciled or explicitly left unresolved, without contradictory recommendations |
| 7 | **Top-blocker traceability** | Every top blocker or concern maps to the corresponding surviving finding ID and its severity |
| 8 | **Severity consistency** | Comparable evidenced effects receive consistent severity, with any material difference explained |
| 9 | **Integration hooks** | Every hook maps to a surviving finding ID; a finding may carry zero or multiple applicable hooks |
| 10 | **Blind-spot statement** | The section names actual limits, or a supported none-identified statement within a declared scope |

Check 3 grades honesty, not completeness of inspection: an `unassessed` row with a reason and the next evidence needed passes. Check 9 grades traceability, not cardinality: a finding with no applicable hook and a finding with three both pass, and only a hook citing no surviving finding fails. Check 10 accepts a none-identified statement bounded by a declared scope and fails an empty section or an invented limit.

The meta-score measures how well the report conforms to these rules. It is not a measure of artifact correctness, and it never certifies that inspection was exhaustive.

## Final-finding schema

A finding that survives into the final report keeps every field the producing agent supplied and adds:

- **Host verification:** what the host re-read or re-ran to keep the finding, and the outcome. This is the host's own record, never a human disposition; `accepted`, `rejected`, `deferred` and `partial` belong only to outcomes captured after the human responds.
- **Source agent IDs:** which of A, B and C raised it, so convergence is visible without counting votes.
- **Recommended action:** a concrete next step, when the finding warrants one. Recommendations cite finding IDs rather than restating findings.

Merged findings map their retired IDs to the surviving ID. Retracted findings keep their ID with the reason for withdrawal, so a reader can tell a merge from a retraction.

## Audit payload identity

The audit payload is the complete final report content before the meta result is added. It is identified by the run ID and a `report_revision`; the meta-agent's return names the `audited_revision` it graded. Score and Auto-Detected Issues are the wrapper that results from the audit and are excluded from the payload, so the audit never grades a score that did not yet exist.

Freeze the payload for the initial two-call meta-agent. One host correction batch may create the next `report_revision` and receive one fresh two-call recheck. Stop after that recheck and retain any unresolved conformance failure at the human gate.

Adding the unchanged wrapper does not invalidate a score. Changing findings, gate, coverage or recommendations does. If later editing or redaction changes audited content, recheck within that same allowance or present the revision as unaudited and keep the old score only as history. Never award a new score by host calculation and never silently reuse the old one. Missing artifact proof is withdrawn or stays a limitation; a wording fix cannot supply evidence.
