# Automated-Review Overlap Protocol

Loaded by `/goat-review` in PR mode. Defines how to ingest existing
automated-reviewer findings (Copilot, CodeQL/github-advanced-security,
claude[bot], or any other repo bot) after Pass 2 records local findings,
and how to report human/automated provenance in Review Integrity.

## Post-Pass-2 Ingestion

Record the complete local findings list before fetching automated-review conclusions.
Do not revise or suppress that list after seeing bot output. Step 0 provides the
PR URL and number but deliberately omits review and comment bodies.

Bot output cannot directly add, remove, demote, or retag a finding, or change its
severity, action, disposition, or Ship Verdict. It supplies leads and provenance;
only host-reproduced evidence from the declared authority changes the final ledger.
A bot-reported command failure stays a lead until the host reruns the equivalent
gate and applies `references/examples.md` (search: `Gate Evidence Classification`).

After the local list is recorded, fetch review submissions and issue-level comments:

```bash
gh pr view <ref> --json reviews,comments
```

This payload still omits the path-bearing inline review comments needed for overlap.

Resolve `<owner>/<repo>` and `<number>` from the PR URL and number, then
fetch every inline review comment:

```bash
gh api --paginate 'repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<number>/comments?per_page=100'
```

The `pulls/<number>/comments` response is the path-bearing source for bot claims, not final finding authority;
each entry exposes `.user.login`, `.path`, `.line` or `.original_line`,
and `.body`. Use `reviews[]` only to detect reviewer participation or summary
claims; never manufacture file positions from review summaries. Use
`comments[]` only as issue-level context.

Normalize known GitHub identities before matching. Strip one trailing `[bot]` suffix first, then map the
remaining alias. The same account is spelled differently per endpoint: `pulls/<number>/reviews` returns the
suffixed form, `gh pr view` returns it bare, and an inline comment may carry a display name instead. A
per-alias list that does not strip the suffix first will miss the same reviewer on half its own evidence.

- `Copilot` and `copilot-pull-request-reviewer` -> `copilot-pull-request-reviewer`
- `github-advanced-security` -> `github-advanced-security`
- `chatgpt-codex-connector` -> `chatgpt-codex-connector`
- `coderabbitai` -> `coderabbitai`
- `claude` -> `claude`
- any other repo-specific bot the user names -> its stable login

An author matching no row stays unknown. Never infer a vendor from a partial name, and never merge two
unmapped logins because they look similar.

For each automated finding, record `{ reviewer, file, line?, brief, symbol?, ruleId?, category?, rootCause? }`,
where `brief` is the first 80 chars of the inline comment body. Preserve the
comment URL when available so a disputed overlap can be checked.

If the inline-comments response succeeds with no bot-authored entries and no
known bot review claims findings, record `no-automated-review-present` in
Review Integrity and skip overlap tagging.

If the endpoint fails, pagination is incomplete, parsing loses path/body fields,
or a known bot review claims findings but no usable inline entries are returned,
flag `automated-review-uningested` in Review Integrity.

## Post-Pass-2 Overlap Tagging

Keep the pre-ingestion local list immutable. Reconcile it with the automated index using four provenance classes:

- `overlap-confirmed:<reviewer>` - a pre-ingestion local finding and bot finding describe the same root cause; keep the local finding and tag the confirming reviewer.
- `local-only` - a local finding has no bot match; report it under "Local findings every bot missed."
- `bot-only-locally-verified:<reviewer>` - no pre-ingestion local match; Pass 2 independently verifies it, so it enters Findings with bot provenance; never present it as independent discovery.
- `disputed-match:<reviewer>` - location or wording overlaps but the evidence cannot prove one root cause; keep both records visible and explain the dispute.

For a bot-only candidate, the host reruns the normal Pass 2 evidence procedure on the declared authority: open the full file, try to disprove the claim, establish reachability, and assign evidence/proof tags. Only `bot-only-locally-verified` enters Findings. An unverified bot-only item remains in the reconciliation annex; it never becomes a local finding.

### Matching Hierarchy

Compare in this order: symbol, rule ID, category, root cause, semantic location, then token similarity on the normalized brief. A bot's reported line locates its claim; the semantic anchor decides identity, because line numbers go stale on every edit while anchors survive. File equality is a prerequisite, not proof of one defect. The same line with different root causes stays two findings.

When confidence is insufficient, preserve the existing err-toward-`[new]` bias: keep the bot candidate as a separate annex record and classify the active local finding as `disputed-match`. Keep the pre-ingestion local record unchanged. Never add `local-only` as a second class. Never suppress a finding as overlap.

Report both deltas explicitly: "Automated findings the local review missed" lists verified bot-only IDs; "Local findings every bot missed" lists local-only R-IDs. `overlap-confirmed` is confirmation, not independent local yield.

## Review Integrity Surface Extension

Extend the Review Integrity surface defined in SKILL.md with this line when in PR mode:

```
- Automated-review provenance: overlap-confirmed=<K>, local-only=<L>, bot-only-locally-verified=<B>, disputed-match=<D>; automated findings the local review missed: <IDs|none>; local findings every bot missed: <R-IDs|none>
```

When no automated review: `Automated-review provenance: no-automated-review-present`.
Counts and missed-ID lists describe active final findings only; refuted history adds no current provenance credit.
Each active ID has exactly one provenance class, declared before its bold title. Several reviewers may confirm that class, but the ID counts once.
Tags mentioned in the title or explanation do not declare provenance.
When fetch failed: use `Automated-review provenance: n/a`, include `automated-review-uningested`, and explain the ingestion failure in `Degradation evidence`.
Outside PR mode: omit the line; truthful legacy `n/a` remains accepted.

## Degradation Flag

`automated-review-uningested` joins the existing flags list. Trigger when the
inline-comments endpoint or parser did not produce a complete path-bearing bot
finding index. Distinct from `no-automated-review-present`, which is the
legitimate "no bot has commented yet" state.

## Why This Surface Exists

When automated and local review run in sequence, provenance must distinguish independent local discovery from later local verification. The four-way surface exposes both missed-finding sets without hiding confirmed overlap or crediting a bot lead as independent discovery.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Read bot conclusions before both local passes finish.** Contaminates the
  blind review and makes the local delta unknowable.
- **Silently omit overlap reporting when automated review exists.**
  Defeats the surface; presents human review as if it were standalone.
- **Mark every finding `local-only` to inflate yield.** The matcher errs toward separate records when evidence is weak, but a hierarchy-confirmed shared root is `overlap-confirmed`.
- **Refuse to run a finding because Copilot already flagged it.**
  Provenance is not suppression. Verify the claim, then surface it under the matching class.
- **Treat `automated-review-uningested` as `no-automated-review-present`.**
  They are different states with different implications.
