# Verification lessons

## Lesson: run `npm run check` after every `src/cli.ts` edit, not just before commit

**Created:** 2026-05-10

`src/cli.ts` is the entire runtime. It compiles under `strict + noUncheckedIndexedAccess + exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, which means a small change (e.g., adding a property to `Finding` without making it optional, or indexing an array without a bounds check) routinely breaks `tsc` even when the diff "looks fine". `npm run check` runs `tsc --noEmit && npm test` — both are needed, both are fast (sub-second `tsc`, ~150ms test). Pasting the literal "0 fail" line from the test runner is the verification artifact; "looks correct" is not.

## Lesson: when changing rule output, regenerate the baseline test scenario, do not edit findings inline

**Created:** 2026-05-10

`src/cli.test.ts` writes a fixture and asserts that specific `ruleId`s appear (`security.eval-call`, `size.parameter-count`, `test-quality.no-assertions`, `modernisation.public-property`). If you alter a rule's `ruleId`, threshold, or matcher, the fixture text — not the assertion list — is the part to expand: add a new bad pattern that triggers the renamed rule. Editing the assertion to "make the test pass" with the existing fixture defeats the test's purpose (proving the rule fires at all).

## Lesson: the deny-dangerous hook treats piping into `python3 -c`/`node -e` as blocked

**Created:** 2026-05-10

`.claude/hooks/deny-dangerous.sh` blocks "pipe to interpreter" patterns. When summarising audit JSON or processing tool output with a one-liner, write to `/tmp/<file>.json` first and then run the interpreter against the file path. Trying to retry the same pipeline after a block triggers the same hook — the lesson is to switch to a file-based intermediate, not to keep retrying.

## Lesson: threshold fixtures must exceed the threshold they are proving

**Created:** 2026-05-13

**What happened:** The M01 high-entropy sensitive-data fixture initially used a 31-character secret-like value while the rule default required 32 characters, so the targeted test failed after implementation until the fixture value was corrected.

**Evidence:** `src/cli.test.ts` + `(search: "const secret =")` - the first-slice fixture owns the candidate value for `sensitive-data.high-entropy-string`.

**Prevention:** When adding threshold-backed rule fixtures, count or otherwise prove the fixture value crosses the threshold before treating a missing finding as an implementation bug.

## Lesson: self-analysis smoke catches scanner regressions that fixtures miss

**Created:** 2026-05-13

**What happened:** M02 unit fixtures passed, but `./bin/gruff-ts analyse src --format=json --fail-on=none --no-config` exposed a `parse-error` in `src/cli.ts` and false positives where control statements were treated as function blocks.

**Evidence:** `src/cli.ts` + `(search: "function parseDiagnostics")` and `(search: "function functionBlocks")`; `src/cli.test.ts` now includes clean control-flow coverage and delimiter-looking literal coverage.

**Prevention:** For regex-heavy rule work, run the analyzer against `src` before declaring the milestone gate done, and check the output for diagnostics plus impossible symbols such as `if`, `switch`, or `catch`.

## Lesson: inspect smoke output, not just exit status

**Created:** 2026-05-13

**What happened:** M03 tests and the HTML smoke command exited 0, but the first HTML inspection showed obvious sensitive-data false positives on `package-lock.json` SRI hashes and the detector string `OPENAI_API_KEY` inside `src/cli.ts`.

**Evidence:** `src/cli.ts` + `(search: "function isHighEntropySecretCandidate")` and `(search: "sensitive-data.api-key-pattern")`; `src/cli.test.ts` now includes `risk expansion ignores package integrity hashes`.

**Prevention:** When adding source-text detectors, inspect a small slice of CLI smoke output for noisy rule ids and filenames. Exit code 0 only proves the command ran; it does not prove the detector is useful.

## Lesson: do not mutate the scanned tree during determinism checks

**Created:** 2026-05-13

**What happened:** The M04 determinism smoke was first run in parallel with baseline generation. The baseline command created `.goat-flow/scratchpad/gruff-ts-expanded-baseline.json` between the two `analyse .` runs, so the comparison reported one extra finding even though the analyzer output was deterministic for a stable tree.

**Evidence:** M04 verification commands; rerunning `./bin/gruff-ts analyse . --format=json --fail-on=none --no-config` twice after baseline generation completed produced identical reports after ignoring `run.generatedAt`.

**Prevention:** Run determinism checks by themselves, or generate any scratchpad/baseline artifacts before the first compared run. Parallel verification is fine only when none of the commands write into paths being scanned.
