# Skill Conventions

Read on **full-depth** invocations or when the preamble routes here; `skill-preamble.md` always loads first.

---

## Learning Loop - Entry Formats

Use project-specific buckets such as `verification.md` or `runtime.md`.

Route entries to `.goat-flow/learning-loop/lessons/`, `patterns/`, or `footguns/`; never to a monolithic log or README.

Before adding, Extract / Consolidate / Skip: search the relevant INDEX and bucket; update one root cause across symptoms; create only distinct causes; skip non-decision-changing material.

Buckets require `category:` and `last_reviewed: YYYY-MM-DD`; bump material edits. `stats --check` rejects malformed/stale metadata or refs.

Each bucket's `README.md` owns its full entry shape, metadata order, evidence labels, and optional fields; read the one you are writing to. The footgun shape is repeated here because it carries the evidence choice every bucket shares:

```markdown
<!-- Footgun bucket -->
---
category: hooks
last_reviewed: YYYY-MM-DD
---

## Footgun: [Title]

**Status:** active | **Created:** YYYY-MM-DD | **Evidence:** <choose one: ACTUAL_MEASURED, OBSERVED, or EXTERNAL_REFERENCE>
**Decision changed:** [what future work does differently]
**Trigger phase:** READ | SCOPE | ACT | VERIFY (optional)
**hallucination-risk:** high

**Prevention:** [rule to prevent recurrence]

**Symptoms:** [what breaks]

**Why it happens:** [root cause]

**Evidence:** `file` + semantic anchor (function name, unique string, or `(search: "pattern")`) - [what was found]
```

Never use a hypothetical as evidence.

## Adaptive Step 0

Reuse 2-3 overlapping session logs instead of re-deriving context.

**The gate rule:** Infer supplied answers. With clear intent, target, and boundary, confirm once and proceed. Ask only at a genuine fork. A detailed brief or "skip Step 0" proceeds.

**Planning/interview boundary:** Default interview budget: one decision-bearing question at a time, no more than three per message or three rounds. Extend only when the user requests a deeper interview. When the budget is exhausted, present remaining choices with a recommended default and stop. Planning permission is not implementation permission. Do not implement unless the original directive authorized implementation or the user now selects it.

A clear implementation directive proceeds after required READ and SCOPE; do not manufacture interview questions. "Update the plan" means write the plan, not execute it: a plan-only request stops at the handoff while explicit implementation authorizes execution.

**Dispatcher invocation:** `/goat` announces the route; Step 0 asks remaining questions without repeating it. One dispatch, one intake gate.

## Contradiction Check

Flag mismatches between stated complexity and actual scope:
- "hotfix" but 5+ files affected → likely Standard or System
- "small feature" but crosses 3+ boundaries → likely System
- "quick test" but 20+ functions in target → warn scope is larger than implied

Surface the mismatch, suggest re-classification, and never proceed silently.

## Stuck Protocol

If 3 consecutive file reads produce no new signal relevant to the current question:
1. Present what you have so far
2. State what you were looking for and didn't find
3. Ask the human to redirect, narrow scope, or close

**Sub-agent mode:** When invoked as a sub-agent (forked context), most BLOCKING GATEs become CHECKPOINTs (logged, not paused). Step 0 proceeds with auto-detected scope. **Exception:** the goat-debug D2→D3 "human decides before fixing" safety gate, the separate goat-debug D3 implementation approval, and the goat-clarity Scope v2 approval gate MUST remain blocking even in sub-agent mode - they prevent unreviewed fixes or authority expansion. Approvals worded as explicit current-session approval, such as diagnostic mutation and bisect, are not gate conversions and never downgrade.

## Task Tracking

For plan or milestone work, tick each task `- [x]` immediately, never at batch end or closeout. Checkboxes recover state after interruption or compaction; tick any missed completion before continuing.

Compact at ~60% context or 15+ turns. On `/compact` without an active milestone, write current state to `.goat-flow/logs/sessions/`. Milestones are primary continuity; session logs are fallback.

Handoff receipts: read `.goat-flow/logs/sessions/README.md`; redact before writing.

## Durable Artifact Redaction

Artifact text follows `skill-preamble.md` → Durable Local Text Redaction, which every invocation already loads, so Quick depth reaches the same rule. Keep artifact-specific destinations and specialized savers at their callers.

## Presenting Findings

Use the active skill's output contract. Otherwise, present user-facing tasks, findings, or recommendations as:

- **Summary:** what's affected (one line)
- **Problem:** what's wrong (one line)
- **Solution:** what to do (one line)

## Milestone Lifecycle (goat-plan)

`goat-plan` owns milestone status, lanes, receipts, human gates, and the final join: read its Phase 3 and Phase 4, plus its milestone-examples reference → Status reason, Lane lifecycle, and Timing receipts. Another skill that resumes an interrupted milestone task ticks only that task under Task Tracking and Recovery; it never changes a status, lane, receipt, or another lane's work.

## Orchestration Admission

Before an optional repeated, parallel, delegated, review, QA, or critique pass, record:

Budget Ledger:
- Phase:
- Initial budget:
- Spent evidence:
- Proposed extra pass:
- New evidence expected:
- Failure class:
- Independence boundary:
- Objective per subagent:
- Why tasks are independent:
- Merge boundary:
- Budget/call cap:
- Return schema:
- Conflict owner:
- Stop condition:
- Decision: admitted | deferred | denied

A repeated pass must name a new failure class, independence boundary, or explicit user request. Admit it for blast-radius risk, targeted failed-verification evidence, useful independent context, or security/correctness value above cost.

Same-context reassurance with no new evidence is denied. Parallel tasks sharing files require a named merge boundary and conflict owner. Subagents keep one objective and structured return. Scouts get 5 tool calls; implementation gets 5 plus the task's estimated minutes, up to 20 tool calls, with larger tasks split first.

Required skill phases and verification are pre-admitted; cost cannot degrade or block them. Explicit `goat-critique` stays full delegated mode and preserves consent. This is rough admission control, not token accounting or a hard failure based only on estimated cost.

## Recovery

When a skill fails mid-execution (context limit, sub-agent death, tool error):

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Partial completion | Identify last completed step (last `[x]` checkbox in milestone file), resume from next |
| Missing artifacts | Return to the step that generates them, re-execute |
| Corrected twice on same approach | STOP and rewind the current hypothesis; ask for a different debugging angle |
| User wants restart | Re-run from Step 0 |
| User wants to skip | Document skip reason in output, proceed to closing |

When blocked: ask one question with a recommended default.

## Interrupt Freeze Protocol

If the user interrupts, says "stop", "don't change anything", "no changes", or otherwise rejects file edits, freeze writes immediately. Only run read-only status or diff checks needed to report current state. Do not revert, clean up, archive, delete, or patch files unless the user explicitly asks for that action after the freeze.

## Autonomy Awareness

Before proposing actions that change files, check the instruction file's Ask First
boundaries. If the proposed change crosses an Ask First boundary, flag it:
"This change touches [boundary]. Proceeding requires approval per Ask First rules."

## Authoring a Skill

For new or materially behaviour-changing goat-* skills, load `.goat-flow/skill-docs/skill-quality-testing/README.md`: `tdd-iteration.md` first, `adversarial-framing.md` for review classes, and `deployment.md` before release. Behaviour-neutral typo, link, or citation fixes need focused contract proof. Verify skill/reference stamps match `goat-flow --version` before publishing.

Before writing a skill, playbook, shared preamble or conventions file, instruction file, hook message, or README discovery row, load `.goat-flow/skill-docs/playbooks/writing-agent-facing-instructions.md`.
